# device_scheduler
Simple device scheduler for a specific number of tasks.

## Setup/Imports.

This program makes use of: 
- Python 3.5.6
- time library (import time)

## Additional notes
I did not manage to replicate the exact behavior given on the paper. Despite having taken into account the given constraints, I am unsure of why only task A runs after the first second.Task B should be able to run as well. Anyway, I hope the code is clear and thoroughly explained! Enjoy :)
